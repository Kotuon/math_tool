## Introduction

I created this small program to quickly visualize Bezier Curves and export the control point values to a CSV. My motivation for making this tool was to have a streamlined process for creating a curve and then using it in an interpolation system I made for Unreal Engine 5.Â 

For computing the curve, I used De Casteljau's algorithm with binomial coefficients that are calculated at the start of the program.
